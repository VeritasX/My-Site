    <h1>I Am A Continuously Self Educated Developer...</h1>

    <p>I love to learn, especially if I am learning anything that pertains to front end web development. I am very interested in Javascript and various JavaScript Frameworks such as: Angular Js, Angular Material, and  Node. Currently I am Working at company called Tre'vo  as IT Help Desk/Junior Developer, where I am learning more about Javascript and Angular JS, I help with various IT related tasks through out the office. </p><h2>I am a Geek!!!</h2><p> In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my wife and children, as well as my family, church family, and friends. I enjoy playing minecraft with my boys, reading comic books, watching Doctor who, Arrow and the Flash, and listening to podcasts ranging from my beliefs to superheroes, I love to read and hope my children will to.  </p> <h2>Things I Would Like To Learn In the Future</h2><p>It goes without saying that when you begin to code and you discover that there are other languages out there that are more capable at creating certain experiences, its hard not to want to learn them while you are learning your first language. I tried ruby once while I was in the early stages of learning javascript, and as a result of not having enough experience programming, It was very hard to learn and I eventually droped the language altogether. So..Here are a few things I would like to learn later on and why
</p><p>Python: I would like to learn python because of its abilty to be used on multiple platforms and especially on the rasbery pi</p><p>More User Experience: because I came from more of design background (before coding) I have had some courses in User Experience. As I am not able to dive into this right now, this is a subject I would love to get to know more about. I believe that the experience of the user is extremely important not only does it affect the users experience on the site but it also changes the users perception of the company or organization that owns that site. Every product is a message. </p>

    <p>I love to code. I know that you cant learn JavaScript just by doing tutorials and reading books you have to write and debug your own code. My github is where I store all my projects some of them are complete some of them may be ideas that I will come back to later. Please check out all my repositories!  </p>
